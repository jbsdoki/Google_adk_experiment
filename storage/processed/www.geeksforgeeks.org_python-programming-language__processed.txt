Python is:
A high-level language, used in web development, data science, automation, AI and more.
Known for its readability, which means code is easier to write, understand and maintain.
Backed by library support, so we don’t have to build everything from scratch, there’s probably a library that already does what we need.
Why to Learn Python?
Python requires fewer lines of code compared to other programming languages.
Python is in high demand as it provides many job opportunities in Software Development, Data Science and AI/ML.
Python provides popular Web Development, AI/ML, Data Science and Data Analysis Libraries like Django, Flask, Pandas, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn and many more.
Python is an object oriented programming language which encapsulates code within object.
Python is cross-platform which works on Windows, Mac and Linux without major changes.
Python is used by big companies like Google, Netflix and NASA.
